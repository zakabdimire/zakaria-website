        <p class="history">
            In the history of football, not a single nation has been as successful at it as Brazil. They have won five World Cup titles (most ever), and they remain the only team to have participated at every edition of the tournament. Over the years, Brazil produced some of the greatest players in the world, and many pundits consider their 1970 team to be the best squad to play the game. Their trophy room also contains eight Copa Am√©rica titles and four Confederations Cups. To find out more press the link below.
