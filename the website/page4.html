            The history of the England national football team begins with the first representative international match in 1870 and the first officially recognised match two years later. They have won one World Cup, in 1966 on home soil, and since they first entered in 1950 have played in 15 of the 18 finals tournaments to 2018; they were knocked out in qualifying tournaments for 1974, 1978, and 1994. England staged the European Championships in 1996.
