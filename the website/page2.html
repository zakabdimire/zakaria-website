            This is a record of France's results at the FIFA World Cup. France was one of the four European teams that participated at the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and have appeared in 15 FIFA World Cups, tied for the sixth most of any country. The national team is one of eight to have won the FIFA World Cup title and one of only six to have done so more than once.

The French team won its first World Cup title in 1998. The tournament was played on home soil and France defeated Brazil 3–0 in the final match. The tournament was hosted in France once before in 1938, where France was eliminated by defending champions Italy in the quarterfinals. In 2018, France won the World Cup for the second time, defeating Croatia 4–2 in the final at the Luzhniki Stadium in Russia. To find out more press the link below.
